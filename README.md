NodeJS: as part of day to day, I need to work on AWS Serverless programming model using AWS SDK for JavaScript. More information can be found in [https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/). With the current client we opted NodeJS with TypeScript with NodeJS 12 as Runtime. AWS Lambdas are computed modules (Functions) where business logic is built. AWS CDK using Typescript is used to build the Microservices on AWS Cloud. More Information can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/work-with-cdk-typescript.html
